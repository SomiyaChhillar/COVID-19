# India  COVID-19 ðŸ¦  Data Scrape

Data scraping is done using **BeautifulSoup** and **requests**. Data has been scraped from **[MohHFW](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/)** website, the official website for COVID-19 for India. 


# Environment ðŸ’»

The envirnoment can be created using Anaconda in both Linux and Windows. Versions for packages might be different for them. The file covid.yml is set up in a Windows system.

To create teh same environment:

    conda env create -f covid.yml
To activate the environment:

    conda  activate  ytscrape

P.S. : Sorry I was using the same environment for scraping YouTube caption a while back and hence the name of the environment.
